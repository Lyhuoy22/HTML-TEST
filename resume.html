                <h2>About ME</h2>
                <p>I started to learn web development right from the first year of my college. 
                    In my school days , my knowledge of computer science was almost nill. 
                    As a JEE aspirant , I always focused on the subjects which can provide me with a good college . 
                    In my school , computer was a very underestimated subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cv-material">
                <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>Now I have learnt many concepts of web development. 
                    But now also, what I know is a drop, 
                    what I don't know is an ocean. 
                    And this is the best thing about web development . 
                    You never stop learning . Everyday new technologies are coming and 
                    you won't be able to keep yourself away from that once you taste 
                    this blood of web development.</p>
                <h2>DATABASE</h2>
                <p> I got into web development an year back. I started in Java, 
                    yes I know... Java. Before that I was not so keen to get into web development. 
                    I was interested in android development as I had done 
                    a course on that and wanted to pursue it further. 
                    Story for another time I guess. My point is once 
                    I got into web development, it completely changed me. 
                </p>
                <h2>SEO Optimization</h2>
                <p>I knew the basic concepts but I didn't know where and how to apply them. 
                    And that's the time I met someone. I don't want to tell publicly who it is, 
                    but he was really an oasis in the desert for me. 
                    He guided me in the right direction. 
                    He helped me whenever and wherever necessary. 
                    He was the one who told me practice is the best thing someone can do.</p>
                <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
                <p>I think Javascript gave me too much to learn. 
                    At the first days of me learning Javascript, 
                    the coolest thing i would do with it was making 
                    alerts and maybe form validation. Nothing much. 
                    Then i came across frontend frameworks that use javascript. 
                    Modals, Tooltips blablabla. So much stuff and i had to go back 
                    to javascript and research more on it. Since the journey started 
                    i have learnt endless stuff and now i am a fullstack developer. 
                    So much has changed.
